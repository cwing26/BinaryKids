Helping kids learn to convert between binary and base 10

TODO:

fix names of all classes;
reorganize packages;
clean-up and comment code;
unit tests;
change all coords to constants;
load all images on welcome page;
resolve next button;
figure out deployment;

any other exception handling??? - not sure, we will have to thoroughly check all code;
meghan will comment pre tutorial learning pages tonight/tomorrow morning;


TO DO APRIL 27 MORNING:
-better way to present instructions for bin dec tutorials (font size must be 15 or larger, think about highlighting different parts of instructions like singh said)
-fix card layouts in welcome so pre tutorial animations don’t start until their respective screen appears
-fix inconsistent back/next buttons 

Semi ambitious:
game = binary tetris, have screen getting higher to top

Ambitious:
drag drop for rectangles

Game:
1. game stats, pause button, stop button, need to be in dedicated different color panel on the bottom or left of the screen
2. make score progress and time progress bar longer
3. questions should be on a different color panel background, right now they don’t stand out
4. for binary tetris, every 20 seconds, the current question could just turn into a long rectangle, move up screen, and a new question could appear to simulate tetris. 
OR 
the button panel itself could be slowly rising and then go back to bottom once question has been answered…this would probs be easier
5. fix location of labels and places
6. exponential scoring
7. congrats you’re awesome page
