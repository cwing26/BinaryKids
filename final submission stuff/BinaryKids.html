  	<p> Welcome to the BinaryKids learning application!!</p>
  	</br> </br> 
  	
  	<p> Dear Educator or Parent, </p>
	
	<p>
	BinaryKids is an interactive web application designed to give middle school-aged children an introduction to the binary number system and its importance to computer science. 
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	While most elementary-aged children are taught basic math concepts, they are rarely introduced to their real life applications and importance. Data show that this phenomenon decreases studentsâ€™ propensity to pursue technical careers in the long run, and weakens our national innovation gap with other countries. By 2020, the United States will have more than 1 million vacant programming/computing jobs with only 400,000 computer science graduates available to fill them. This application attempts to fix the social/educational problem of students not being introduced to math/CS in a manageable way at an early age by teaching elementary-aged children about binary numbers and their application. 
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	This applet consists of a tutorial and game to introduce young students to binary numbers, illustrating their importance to CS/computing, application, and conversion methods from base-10 numbers. The tutorial features an interactive walk-through of what binary numbers are, how they form the basic principles for computing and electronics, and how they differ from decimal (base-10) numbers. 
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	Specific learning modules include:
	</p> 
	
	<p>-Introduction to Binary Numbers </p> 
	<p>-Interactive Decimal to Binary Conversion</p> 
	<p>-Interactive Binary to Decimal Conversion</p> 
	<p>-Multi-level card game that tests conversion skills. </p> 

	<p>
	The system will be deployed on any computer via an applet run in a web browser, but will not be supported on mobile computing devices. The target environment and audience are middle school students (7th-9th grade) with previous knowledge of basic computer skills (typing, maneuvering between pages) and who already have knowledge of basic math in base-10 (addition/subtraction/multiplication/division).  
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	This application can be incorporated into a standard algebra math curriculum into units on exponents or logarithms, or can be presented as a stand-alone lesson that introduces students to the relationship between math and computer science. 
  	</p>
  	
  	<p>
	 The applet has been deployed below. Please reach out with any questions, and enjoy!!
