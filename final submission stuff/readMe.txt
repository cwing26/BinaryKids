Applet Name: Binary Kids

Team: Meghan Anand, Chris Wing, Julia Kieserman, De’Ahna Johnson

Concept: This application, named BinaryKids, is an interactive learning applet designed to give middle school-aged students an introduction to the binary number system and its importance to computing. It is divided into four main parts, the pre-tutorial leaning module, the binary to decimal conversion learning module, the decimal to binary conversion learning module, and a game called binary blast. The applet also contains unit testing for key units of work in each module and the game. The applet is accompanied by a basic html page outlining the utility of the application, its social good application, and the learning situations in which it should be primarily used. External resources and guides used are also listed on this webpage. 

Deployment: We have a working jar file and also semi-successful deployment in a
webpage. While the html/jnlp deployment method doesn’t seem to be working on any browser, an html deployment method works on some browsers (Firefox)—this is carried out in deployBinaryKids.html. You might have to lower your security settings, and add the codebase url as well as the html url to your list of exception sites on java control panel, but it should work after that. 

Extra functionality: We have a pretty large code base with three separate learning modules in addition to a game that seek to teach a pretty complex mathematical concept. Rather than just having a game or a tutorial/informative applet, we combine both with significant graphics and some animation. Our MVC infrastructure has more than 25 different views with unique content,
