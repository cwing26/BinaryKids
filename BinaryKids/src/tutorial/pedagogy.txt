1.	representations of numbers (decimal, roman numeral, blocks) how theyre used
2.	one system of numbers you might not be familiar with is binary, which we’re going to teach you

3.	binary numbers are essential for computers….checkboxes. 
4.	you use computers for these things, but actually all of these use binary!! Lots of images. (social media, cell phones)

5.	where does binary comes from?
6.	Comes from root bi, root two. Images of bicycle and binocular. 

7.	Before we talk about binary, lets talk about decimal ..show how places are derived using a base 10 system, which is what they already know. 
8.	Exponent base thing 
9.	Decimal numbers can be from 0-9 (values in each place) 

10.	Show different places in binary are derived from powers of two. (2^0)
11.	Binary numbers use a  base2 system, they can only be 0 and 1 

12.	Show a quick conversion to illustrate different places in decimal/binary


13.	WHAT IS SIGNIFICance? Why would you ever want to know about these numbers? –diff number systems apply to different situations
14.	One situation where they fit is computers/electronics/electricity. One means something is turned, on and 0 means turned off
15.	This is basic principle that was used to build comp youre using now. 

16.	Completed progress on page 4 
17.	Play music after each right answer
